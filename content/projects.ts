    description: `My mission was to develop a new website company from scratch.

    I had talks with the designer and stakeholders to better understand the business rules and UX.

    Created the user experience that fetched, parsed, and formatted analytic data and relayed it into React components.

    This results in accessible, responsive, and functional user interfaces that allow visitors on any device to have the same perfect user experience.

    I used Strapi for the content management system.`,
